## Setup

### Home Assistant

Enable mqtt discovery by adding to HASS config:

```yaml
mqtt:
  broker: localhost # Depends on your setup
  discovery: true
```

### Deploy with Balena.io

* Add a custom fleet configuration variable in project:
    * `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_dtoverlay=w1-gpio`
* Add remote your balena remote:
    * `git remote add balena <USERNAME>@git.balena-cloud.com:<USERNAME>/<APPNAME>.git`
* Push to balena:
    * `git push balena master`

## Electrical Components

> **_VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:_**  THIS IS NOT A HOW-TO instructional guide. This explains how I used a Raspberry Pi to control electric current. However, I am NOT an electrician, and just because I did something doesnâ€™t mean YOU should, particularly if you are unfamiliar with how to wire electrical devices safely. If you choose to follow the method I used, you do so at your own risk.

### Parts I used

* [Raspberry PI model B](https://www.google.com/search?q=Raspberry+PI+Model+B)
* [Kudom 40 A Solid State Relay](https://www.google.com/search?q=Kudom+40+A+Solid+State+Relay)
* [DS18b20 temperature sensor](https://www.google.com/search?q=ds18b20+temperature+sensor)
* [4.7k ohm resistor](https://www.google.com/search?q=4.7k+ohm+resistor)
