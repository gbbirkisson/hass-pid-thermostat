<h1>hass-pid-thermostat</h1>

A PID (climate) controller for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to heat/cool something using a thermometer and a SSR relay. Here is an example of a card that shows up in Home Assistant:

## Setup

### Home Assistant

Enable mqtt discovery by adding to HASS config:

```yaml
mqtt:
  broker: localhost # Depends on your setup
  discovery: true
```

### Deploy with Balena.io

* Edit the `config.txt` in balena-boot partition of the SD card and append the following lines:
    * `dtoverlay=w1-gpio`
* Add remote your balena remote:
    * `git remote add balena <USERNAME>@git.balena-cloud.com:<USERNAME>/<APPNAME>.git`
* Push to balena:
    * `git push balena master`

## Electrical Components

> **_VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:_**  THIS IS NOT A HOW-TO instructional guide. This explains how I used a Raspberry Pi to control electric current. However, I am NOT an electrician, and just because I did something doesnâ€™t mean YOU should, particularly if you are unfamiliar with how to wire electrical devices safely. If you choose to follow the method I used, you do so at your own risk.

### Parts I used
